Currently, many countries are dealing with groups refusing available recommended 
vaccinations. Despite several studies having demonstrated the efficacy of 
mandatory vaccinations in ensuring herd immunity, opposition is widespread. The 
aim of our study was to systematically review published studies evaluating 
attitudes towards mandatory vaccination programs. PubMed and Scopus scientific 
databases were searched and 4,198 results were returned, of these 29 met the 
inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies assessed attitudes towards mandatory 
vaccination programs in general, while 9 papers focused specifically on the 
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine. Most of the studies were performed in 
Europe and North America. According to the assessed studies, the majority of the 
population seems to be in favour of compulsory vaccinations, although attitudes 
differed among studies. The results presented in this review could be an 
important starting point to further understand the issue of vaccine hesitancy 
and support the implementation of effective vaccination strategies.

This study engaged health professionals in in-depth, semi-structured interviews 
to explore their opinions concerning the issues surrounding vaccine hesitancy in 
Malaysia and strategies to improve vaccination to stamp the rise of vaccine 
preventable diseases (VPDs). Opinions on how to address the resurgence of VPDs 
in the era of increasing vaccine hesitancy were obtained. Eight health 
professionals, including geriatricians, pediatricians, microbiologists, public 
health specialists, and family medicine specialists were interviewed. The 
influence of anti-vaccination propaganda, past-experience of adverse event 
following immunization (AEFI), perceived religious prohibition, a belief that 
traditional complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) use is safer, 
pseudoscience beliefs, and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories were identified as 
reasons for refusing to vaccinate. The interplay of social, cultural and 
religious perspectives in influencing perceived religious prohibition, 
pseudoscience beliefs, and the use of TCAM contributing to vaccine refusal was 
found. Five broad themes emerged from the health professionals regarding 
strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, including establishing an electronic 
vaccination registry, increasing public awareness initiatives, providing 
feedback to the public on the findings of AEFI, training of front-line 
healthcare providers, and banning the dissemination of anti-vaccine information 
via social media. With regards to identifying strategies to address the 
resurgence of VPDs, mandatory vaccination received mixed opinions; many viewed 
supplementary immunization activity and the prevention of travel and migration 
of unvaccinated individuals as being necessary. In conclusion, the present study 
identified unique local cultural, traditional and religious beliefs that could 
contribute to vaccine hesitancy in addition to issues surrounding vaccination 
refusal similarly faced by other countries around the world. This information 
are important for the formulation of targeted intervention strategies to stamp 
vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia which are also a useful guide for other countries 
especially in the Southeast Asia region facing similar vaccine hesitancy issues.

BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy has increased worldwide, leading to reduction in 
vaccination coverage rates. In particular, reduction in the coverage for the 
trivalent Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine has led to an increase of measles cases. 
The aim of this study is to analyze the coverage rates for the MMR vaccine in 
the Emilia-Romagna Region (RER) and Sicily Region (SR) between 2009 and 2018, 
and to correlate any significant change to index events which could have 
modified the trend of vaccination rates.
METHODS: Official aggregate data on vaccination coverage at 24 months provided 
by the RER and the SR were analyzed through trend analysis and related to 
important index events.
RESULTS: The two regions showed similar results; both achieved the lowest 
coverage rates in 2015 and both showed an increase in the rates after the 
introduction of mandatory vaccinations for access to schools. In 2018, both 
reached the starting point before the decrease.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the effectiveness of legislative coercive 
measures in favor of vaccination. A potential decrease in the coverage rates may 
be observed as a result of an attenuation of the positive effects of coercive 
measures over time. It is thus necessary to combine these measures together with 
information campaigns and political initiatives at different levels (i.e. 
national, regional).

BACKGROUND: Declining vaccination coverage and increasing hesitancy is a 
worldwide concern. Many countries have implemented mandatory vaccination 
policies to promote vaccination. However, mandatory vaccination policies differ 
significantly by country. Beyond case studies, no comprehensive study has 
compared these policies or the penalties for non-compliance on a global scale.
METHODS: We conducted extensive keyword, policy, and literature searches to 
identify mandatory national vaccination policies globally and develop a 
comprehensive database. A mandatory national vaccination policy was defined as a 
policy from a national authority that requires individuals to receive at least 
one vaccination based on age or to access a service. Two reviewers independently 
evaluated evidence for a mandate and whether non-compliance penalties were 
incorporated. We categorized penalties into four types, based on the nature of 
the penalty. These penalties impact an individual's financial, parental rights, 
educational (i.e., child's school entry and access), and liberty status. We 
rated the severity within each category.
RESULTS: Of 193 countries investigated, 54% (n = 105) had evidence of a 
nationwide mandate as of December 2018. The frequency, types, and severity of 
penalties varied widely across all regions. We found that 59% (n = 62) of 
countries with national mandates defined at least one penalty for non-compliance 
with a vaccine mandate. Among those, educational penalties (i.e., limiting a 
child's entry or ongoing access to school) were the most common (69%; n = 43), 
with most countries with educational penalties refusing school enrollment until 
vaccination requirements are met (81%; n = 35).
CONCLUSION: We undertook a comprehensive assessment of national mandatory 
vaccination policies and identified a diversity of penalties in place to promote 
compliance. Our results highlight the need to critically evaluate the 
implementation of non-compliance penalties in order to determine their 
effectiveness and to define best practices for sustaining high vaccination 
uptake worldwide.

Vaccinating children is amongst the most cost-effective interventions for 
reducing children's morbidity and mortality. Parents who choose not to vaccinate 
their children despite having been informed about the evidence on safety and 
efficacy of vaccines may seriously jeopardise the health of both their own 
children and others. Contemporary ethical thinking about the limits of parental 
decision-making over their children's healthcare treatment often considers the 
zone of parental discretion. However, with vaccination this is slightly less 
direct as the benefits are not only accumulated by an individual child but also 
by children as a population. Forcing parents is of course not the only solution 
to counteracting the fear of vaccines. Health authorities should certainly fund 
research and deploy resources on combatting vaccine disinformation.Conclusion: 
It would be preferable to achieve high rates of vaccination coverage by 
educating both parents and physicians without adopting any legislation for 
mandatory vaccination. However, in countries where vaccination uptake is low 
and/or outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases occur, the implementation of 
mandatory vaccination will most probably save children's lives. EAP calls for 
action to make all scheduled childhood vaccinations a matter of fact for all 
European children.

BACKGROUND: Also in Italy, a flourishing evidence confirms the recent spread of 
vaccine hesitancy movements resulting in approximately 4-7% of the paediatric 
population not immunised every year against polio and approximately 9-15% 
against measles in the last few years. The aim of this paper is to describe the 
reasons of polio and measles missed vaccination in Italy, in the period 
2015-2017, and to analyse any potential effect of the 2017 mandatory vaccination 
law.
METHODS: Number of missed vaccinations in children younger than 24 months, 
stratified by reason, were collected separately for measles and polio with a 
regional level of detail. Data were collected using an electronic form developed 
using Microsoft Excel®.
RESULTS: The most frequent reason for missed polio vaccination was "definitive 
informed dissent" with a mean value 1.5%, followed by "found/contacted, but did 
not attend the appointment" with a mean value 1.3%. Inversely, "acquired 
immunity subsequent to previous disease or vaccination performed elsewhere" and 
"excused in a permanent way for health conditions" were the less frequent with a 
mean value 0.03% for both. For measles vaccination the reason "found/contacted, 
but did not attend the appointment" was the most frequent (mean value 3.2%), 
followed by "definitive informed dissent" (mean value 2.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Percentage of missed vaccination showed a remarkable reduction in 
2017. This decrease is likely due to the introduction of mandatory vaccination 
law. In point of fact, "Dissent" decreased for both polio and measles during the 
study period. While, "Delay" increased during the 3-years. It seems that 
hesitant parents prefer to postpone vaccinations instead of refusing them. 
Counselling, parents' empowerment and vaccine education are central to contrast 
vaccination postponing. Thus, for parents who refuse vaccines ("Dissent"), 
monitoring the trend is important as well as trying to understand their reasons.

BackgroundVaccination policy in France was previously characterised by the 
coexistence of eight recommended and three mandatory vaccinations for children 
younger than 2 years old. These 11 vaccines are now mandatory for all children 
born after 1 January 2018.AimTo study the French population's opinion about this 
new policy and to assess factors associated with a positive opinion during this 
changing phase.MethodsA cross-sectional survey about vaccination was conducted 
from 16 November-19 December 2017 among the GrippeNet.fr cohort. Data were 
weighted for age, sex and education according to the French population. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors 
associated with a favourable opinion on mandatory vaccines' extension and 
defined in the '3Cs' model by the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory 
Group of Experts working group on vaccine hesitancy.ResultsOf the 3,222 
participants (response rate 50.5%) and after adjustment, 64.5% agreed with the 
extension of mandatory vaccines. It was considered a necessary step by 68.7% of 
the study population, while 33.8% considered it unsafe for children and 56.9% 
saw it as authoritarian. Factors associated with a positive opinion about the 
extension of mandatory vaccines were components of the confidence, complacency 
and convenience dimensions of the '3Cs' model.ConclusionsIn our sample, two 
thirds of the French population was in favour of the extension of mandatory 
vaccines for children. Perception of vaccine safety and benefits were major 
predictors for positive and negative opinions about this new policy.
