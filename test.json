		"abstract": "Falls due to slips are prevalent in everyday life. The purpose of this study was to determine the reactive recovery responses used to maintain dynamic stability during an unexpected slip, establish the time course of response adaptation to repeated slip perturbations, and distinguish the proactive strategies for negotiating a slippery surface. Twelve young adults participated in the study in which a slip was generated following foot contact on a set of steel free-wheeling rollers. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and the medial head of gastrocnemius on the perturbed limb. Whole body kinematics were recorded using an optical imaging system: from this the center of mass, foot angle, and medial-lateral stability margins were determined. In addition, braking/loading and accelerating/unloading impulses while in contact with the rollers and the rate of loading the rollers were determined from ground reaction forces. Results demonstrate that the reactive recovery response to the first slip consisted of a rapid onset of a flexor synergy (146–199 ms), a large arm elevation strategy, and a modified swing limb trajectory. With repeated exposure to the slip perturbation, the CNS rapidly adapts within one slip trial through global changes. These changes include the attenuation of muscle response magnitude, reduced braking impulse, landing more flat-footed, and elevating the center of mass. Individuals implement a “surfing strategy” while on the rollers when knowledge of the surface condition was available before hand. Furthermore, knowledge of a slip results in a reduced braking impulse and rate of loading, a shift in medial-lateral center of mass closer to the support limb at foot contact on the rollers and a more flat foot landing. In conclusion, prior experience with the perturbations allows subsequent modification and knowledge of the surface condition results in proactive adjustments to safely traverse the slippery surface.",

		"abstract": "Objectives\nTo investigate the short- and long-term effects of a task- and context-specific balance training program on dynamic balance and functional performance, and to explore the effects on preventing total and injurious falls in parkinsonian nonfallers.\nDesign\nA randomized controlled trial with group allocation single-blinded to the assessor.\nSetting\nCommunity centers, malls, and outdoor parks.\nParticipants\nNonfallers with Parkinson disease (PD) (N=70; mean age ± SD, 61.2±8.8y) randomly assigned to either a balance (BAL) group (n=32) or a control (CON) group (n=38).\nInterventions\nThe BAL group received 4 weeks of indoor and 4 weeks of outdoor balance training (with a 2-h session per week). The CON group received 8 weeks of upper limb training at the same dosage. Both groups were instructed to perform 3 hours of home exercise weekly posttraining.\nMain Outcome Measures\n(1) Dynamic balance performance: Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest); (2) Functional performance: functional reach (FR), 5 times sit-to-stand (FTSTS), 1-leg-stance (OLS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and dual-task TUG tests; (3) Fall-related outcomes: ratios of total nonfallers to fallers and noninjurious fallers to injurious fallers, total and injurious fall rates, times to first falls and injurious falls.\nResults\nSixty-eight participants completed training. A total of 7 patients (10%) withdrew before the 6-month follow-up, but not because of any adverse effects. At immediate and 6 months posttraining, the BAL group showed significantly greater improvements (from baseline) than the CON group in Mini-BESTest total scores, FR distances, and OLS times, together with greater time reductions in FTSTS, TUG, and dual-task TUG tests (all P<.05). The number of injurious fallers was significantly lower in the BAL group at 6-month follow-up.\nConclusions\nThis task- and context-specific balance training program improved the dynamic balance and fall-prone functional performance of PD nonfallers for up to 6 months after training. The BAL group showed a reduction in injurious fallers.",

		"abstract": "Purpose \n        The potential of task-specific training as a fall-prevention intervention was studied. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which a task-specific training protocol decreased the number of falls by middle-age and older women after a laboratory-induced trip. Secondary purposes were to explore the ability of trunk kinematics during the initial recovery step and the length of the initial recovery step to correctly classify the trip outcome and to quantify the extent to which the training protocol affected these variables.\n        Methods \n        Healthy community-dwelling women (n = 52) were assigned to either a training group or a control group that received no training. Training group women participated in an individually tailored, task-specific training protocol during which forward-directed stepping responses were necessary to avoid a fall after treadmill-delivered postural disturbances. Following the protocol, the ability to avoid a fall after a laboratory-induced trip was assessed. The primary outcome variable was the success (recover) or failure (fall) of the posttrip stepping response.\n        Results \n        Compared with the control group, there were fewer falls by the trained women after the laboratory-induced trip (P < 0.001; odds ratio = 0.13). Using logistic regression, falls and recoveries after the trip were sensitively classified by trunk flexion angle at the completion of the initial recovery step and the length of the initial recovery step (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.98), the former of which improved as a result of the task-specific training protocol.\n        Conclusions \n        The task-specific training protocol significantly reduced the number of falls after a laboratory-induced trip. Prospective study is required to determine whether this task-specific training reduces falls in the community and, consequently, may complement currently used exercise-based fall prevention intervention methods.",
